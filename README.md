# Speech-Stimuli

The PNG files in the Contours folder contain visual pitch contour curves corresponding to voice recordings of trisyllabic nonsense words. The voice recordings were downloaded from a stimulus database developed by Gupta et al. (2004). Using Praat software (Boersma & Weenink, 2020), the pitch contour was extracted from each voice recording via autocorrelation and smoothed to generate the resulting images.
