# Speech-Stimuli

The Contours folder contains .png files of pitch contours. Each file corresponds to a voice recording of a trisyllabic nonsense word from a stimulus database developed by Gupta et al. (2004). To generate the pitch contours, Praat software (Boersma & Weenink, 2020) was used to extract the pitch contour from each voice recording via autocorrelation. The result was then smoothed and saved as an image.
